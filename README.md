# Instrument-Style-Transfer
This is the code implementation for project submitted as the partial requirement for the [CS753 Automatic Speach Recognition](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pjyothi/cs753/) course.
The architechture of the network used is based on the architechture suggested in [Learning to Discover Cross-Domain Relations
with Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.05192.pdf).

# Instruction
1. Add your 5 sencond audio samples in the two folders for instruments
2. Run the gen_npy module
3. Run the model. The generated samples are saved in result folder
4. Use the gen_audio module by passing the name of the npyfile you want to generate audio for. This will generate the audio.
